###**House Program**

This is a simple example of classes and objects.  Play with it, create more houses, and note the different variations, (commented out).

**Exercise 1:**
*a)* After reviewing the code, add a field to class House named "ownerName", and accessor and mutator methods for it.
*b)* Convert all string member (i.e. instance) variables to pointers to strings.
*c)* Create another constructor which takes as its paramters two strings and an int (to initialize the instance variables).  

**Exercise 2:** Have the body of main() in a loop.  At the beginning of the loop, ask the user to select 1) to create a new house, 2) to display the existing houses, or 3) to quit.  *(Hint: Store the houses in a vector: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/ )*
